<b>Speed running</b>
<i>  <pre>
    The art of absolutly destroying your predecessors, and demonstrating extreme skills in a particular game.
    This is usually carried out in a lenth of time otherwise impossible to the average player. You have and
    absolute disregard for anything accept you, the game, and the ticking clock. There are highs
    and lows of speed running, but all in all it gives big flex energy in the end and you gain your rank amongst
    the elite.
        
    Gamer 1: Hey dude. Have you seen the speedrun that Gamer 3 did?
    Gamer 2: Yeah bro. He broke a record.
        
    Gamer A: Fancy undertaking a speedrun?
    Gamer B: lets do this shit

    <b>NR</b>
    <i>  <pre>
    Standing for *no replies*

    Often used on sc by 11-13 yr olds acting like they're cool or people care about their reply time, but in my life
    used in every other sentence to represent my momentary dip from reality. For example:

    nr carrying
    nr only real ones know
    nr poppin off
    nr built different, ya get me 

    All in all it's pointless, makes no sense, but I cant stop saying it. </pre> </i>

    <b>Lank</b>
    <i>  <pre>
    The name that should have been given to one of the mosters in Back4Blood. He has a phat arm and can absolutely
    whack the shit out of you with it. All in all being hit by him isn't a fun experience, but the name is 10/10
    and a missed opportunity by the devs.

AQA are just a bunch of posh people who think that all children are capable of being fucking geniuses or something.

They're the exam board definition of natural selection where only the smart kids are allowed to continue living.
They evolve and adapt to their shitty ways, whilst everyone else is dead due to a volcano aka stupid
ass questions killing them off.

    <b>Built Different</b>
    <i>  <pre>
A term used to define oneself to be extraordinary at a variety of levels, rather than just above average.
You don’t go by their rules. They are simply beneath you. To be BUILT DIFFERENT is to be on a completely 
different plane of existence in relation to the rest of the world of basic wannabes. </pre> </i>

   <b>Reverserino</b>
  <i>  <pre>
    In reference to the highway code stating that a way of using your vehicle's engine to control your speed is 
    by changing into a lower gear, we would like to normalise the use of reverse, as an additional way to control 
    speed. Whilst at first many may be sceptical, let me stop you right there. Reversing is on the gear stick, 
    hence operates in the form of a gear, so let us break down number stereotypes and allow reverse to be the 
    main character in the reduction of your speed. Additionally, we believe the ability to seamlessly carry out 
    this manoeuvre should be implemented as a feature into all modern cars.

    The artwork produced by the co-CEO perfectly encapsulates the business.
    You drove in the past. But you Reverserino into a brighter future...

The term has come to prominence during the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, and may refer to any

   <b>Thot</b>
  <i>  <pre>
It can stand for 'That Hoe Over There'
A thot is usually active on social media especially instagram and Snapchat. 
On instagram she can be found in pictures of her in the dog filter and is usually half naked. 
On Snapchat she is most likely posting videos of her obnoxiously lip syncing to rap songs, 
while playing with her hair, thinking she looks like Kylie Jenner. Probably wears Calvin Klein, 
Adidas and Nike hats. She has perfect eyeliner and contour and she seems like she doesn't care 
what anyone think's about her. She may come across as a fake, conceited, shallow dumb bitch, 
but deep down she is insecure and unfortunately the only way she gets confidence is by getting 
validation from men on social media by posting pictures showing off her figure and plastic face. 
Next time you see a thot be nicer to them, they still haven't developed fully yet.
    
Hey but if you're a thot good on you, enjoy and embrace your thot life!
1. Jessica look at thot, breathing like she owns the place.
    
2. I hate thots so much! They're everywhere on instagram these days. </pre> </i>
